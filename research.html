                    <p>The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe is a topic
                        of significant interest in astrophysics. Observational data from high-redshift quasars suggest
                        the existence of SMBHs with masses exceeding billions of solar masses, posing challenges to understand their
                        formation mechanisms. Different scenarios for the initial seeds of SMBHs, such as heavy
                        seeds and light seeds, are being explored. In this paper, we investigate the insights that can
                        be gained by comparing and contrasting heavy seed and light seed models for the formation
                        and growth of SMBHs. We discuss various formation scenarios for the seeds of SMBHs,
                        including the merging of smaller black holes, the influence of Lyman-Werner background
                        fluctuations, and the conditions in high-redshift quasar host progenitors. We highlight the
                        advantages and disadvantages of heavy seed and light seed models, and their implications for
                        the assembly mechanisms of SMBHs. We also discuss the potential of detecting gravitational
                        waves from SMBH mergers and future prospects for studying the formation and growth of
                        SMBHs. Overall, comparing and contrasting heavy seed and light seed models can provide
                        valuable insights into the formation and growth of SMBHs and shed light on the nature of
                        these enigmatic objects in the early universe.</p>

                            <p>Black holes, enigmatic cosmic entities,
                                have fascinated astronomers and astrophysicists for
                                decades. In this study, we delve into their intricate
                                behavior, focusing on the Eddington accretion model.
                                This model, named after Sir Arthur Eddington, provides
                                a theoretical framework for understanding how these
                                gravitational giants interact with matter. Our
                                investigation explores a range of initial seed scenarios,
                                considering both light and heavy seeds. These seeds
                                represent the origins and evolution of black holes, from
                                the remnants of massive stars to primordial entities
                                formed in the early universe. By examining these diverse
                                scenarios, we aim to unravel the complex accretion
                                processes that govern black hole growth. To ensure the
                                robustness of our analysis, we employ a root mean
                                square approach, a statistical tool that helps us predict
                                crucial parameters. This method allows us to quantify
                                the dynamic nature of black hole accretion and gain
                                valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving
                                these cosmic phenomena. Our study ultimately aims to
                                provide well-informed conclusions about the behavior of
                                black holes within the Eddington model and try to
                                predict important parameters involved in accretion. By
                                expanding our understanding of these cosmic enigmas,
                                we try to contribute to the ongoing quest to unravel the
                                mysteries of the universe, shedding light on one of its
                                most captivating phenomena..</p>
